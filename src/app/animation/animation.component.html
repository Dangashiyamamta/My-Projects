<p class="reason">Reasons to visit India</p>

    <p>1. The people</p>
    <p class="descriptions">The local people in India, particularly in the rural areas, are some of the kindest and most hospitable people I’ve encountered in all of my travels. Whether you’re invited into a local’s home for a traditional meal or just simply wander the streets and encounter children playing, you’ll surely be touched by the warmth of the locals.</p>

    <p>The Taj Mahal</p>
    <p class="descriptions">The Taj Mahal, one of the seven wonders of the world, is the most iconic symbol of India and is, arguably, the most famous monument in the world. Built by the Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial to his favourite wife, this ‘teardrop on the face of eternity’ is widely considered one of the most beautiful architectural wonders ever created. A visit to this marble mausoleum needs to be on every traveller’s list.</p>

    <p>The food</p>
    <p class="descriptions">The food alone is reason enough to travel to India — I sampled some of the most delicious food I have ever tasted during my travels there. Indians take their food very seriously and the cuisine, just like the country itself, is incredibly diverse.    </p>
    <p class="descriptions">In the North, you’ll taste lots of thick, creamy curries that are moderately spicy. My favourites include mutton rogan josh, parathas and tandoori chicken. The food in the north is heavily influenced by Persian and Mughlai styles of cooking. Southern Indian cuisine is commonly characterised by the use of ingredients such as coconut, seafood and rice and is spicier than food in the north. My favourite southern dishes were the masala dosas and fish coconut curries. Vegetarians are also well catered for in India, due to the large proportion of Hindus who are vegetarian.    </p>

    <p>The holiest river in the world</p>          
    <p class="descriptions">The Ganges River runs 2,525 km from the northern Himalayas all the way to the Bay of Bengal. It is much more than a river to the one billion Hindus in India and beyond, however. It is their lifeblood. Not only does it provide sustenance in the form of fishing, industry and agriculture, it is also believed to transport the prayers of believers to heaven and a dip in the river is said to purify the soul. Many observant Hindus make a pilgrimage to Varanasi, India’s oldest city, to participate in ceremonies or to cremate the dead along the banks of the Ganges. Hindus believe that if the ashes are washed away in the river, the soul is guaranteed to be transported to heaven and will escape the cycle of rebirth.</p>
